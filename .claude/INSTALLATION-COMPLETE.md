### 3. First Skill: metrics-analysis
**Purpose**: Complete CA delivery van weekly metrics analysis
**Triggers**: "Analyze metrics", "Check weekly performance", etc.
**Workflow**:
- Data validation (Nash CSV)
- CPD calculation (with anomaly exclusion)
- Carrier performance (FOX/NTG/FDC)
- Week-over-week trends
- Dashboard validation
- Standard report generation

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Try It Right Now
```
You: "Analyze this week's metrics"
```

Claude will automatically execute the complete workflow:
1. ✅ Validate Nash data integrity
2. ✅ Calculate weighted CPD (excluding batches < 10 orders)
3. ✅ Analyze FOX/NTG/FDC performance
4. ✅ Check week-over-week trends
5. ✅ Validate dashboard alignment
6. ✅ Generate standard report

**Time**: ~5 seconds (vs. 5-10 minutes explaining manually)

## 📚 Documentation Locations

### Getting Started
```bash
# Quick overview (read this first)
cat .claude/QUICK-START.md

# Real-world examples

## 🔄 How It Works

### The Learning Cycle

**Phase 1: First Request (Manual)**
```
You: "Analyze metrics. Load Nash data, calculate CPD excluding small
     batches, check carrier performance, validate dashboard..."

Claude: [Follows your detailed instructions]
System: 🧠 Tracked pattern "analysis" (1/2)
```

**Phase 2: Pattern Detection**
```
You: "Analyze metrics using the same approach"

Claude: "🎓 I'm tracking this pattern. One more similar request
        and I'll create a reusable skill."
        [Executes analysis]

System: 🧠 Pattern "analysis" threshold reached (2/2)
System: ✅ Auto-generated skill: metrics-analysis
```

**Phase 3: Auto-Invocation (Automatic)**
```
You: "Analyze metrics"

Claude: "✅ Using metrics-analysis skill..."
        [Complete workflow executes automatically]
```

## 💡 What Happens Next

### As You Use Claude

**Week 1-2**: System observes patterns
- You explain workflows naturally
- System tracks repetitive requests
- Notifies when threshold reached

**Week 3+**: Skills activate automatically
- Common workflows become one-command
- Consistency improves (same process every time)
- Time saved compounds

### Potential Future Skills

Based on your project, likely candidates:
- 📊 **slack-announcement** - Generate weekly update posts
- 🔍 **anomaly-investigation** - Deep-dive into CPD spikes
- ✅ **data-validation** - Pre-upload CSV format checks
- 🚀 **deployment-checklist** - Pre-deploy validation gates
- 📝 **store-performance** - Individual store deep-dives
- 🌐 **api-docs-lookup** - Search current documentation

**You don't create these manually** - just use Claude normally and they'll emerge!

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Natural Usage
- Don't force it - use Claude normally
- Explain workflows when you need them
- System learns automatically

### 2. Clear Triggers
- Use consistent phrases for similar tasks
- "Analyze metrics" vs. "Do the metrics thing"
- More specific = better detection

### 3. Complete Workflows
- Include validation steps
- Document expected outcomes
- Add error handling

### 4. Iterative Improvement
- Start simple
- Refine based on usage
- Update version numbers

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Triggering?
```bash
# Check skill exists
ls .claude/skills/

# Read trigger phrases
head -20 .claude/skills/metrics-analysis/SKILL.md

# Try explicit phrase from SKILL.md
```

### Want to See Learning?
```bash
# View patterns being tracked
cat .claude/learning/patterns.json | grep -A 3 "intent"

# See created skills
cat .claude/learning/patterns.json | grep -A 3 "skills_created"
```

### Need to Reset?
```bash
# Remove a skill
rm -rf .claude/skills/unwanted-skill/

# Clear learning history (keeps structure)
cat > .claude/learning/patterns.json << 'JSON'
{
  "patterns": [],
  "skills_created": [],
  "metadata": {
    "last_updated": "2025-10-17T00:00:00",
    "threshold": 2
  }
}
JSON
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

### How to Measure Impact

**Time Tracking:**
- Note time for tasks before/after skills
- Track requests that auto-invoke skills
- Measure explanation time saved

**Quality Tracking:**
- Compare consistency of outputs
- Count forgotten steps (should decrease)
- Track validation pass rates

**Adoption Tracking:**
```bash
# Skills created
ls .claude/skills/ | wc -l

# Patterns tracked
cat .claude/learning/patterns.json | grep -c "signature"

# Skill invocations (manual tracking or logs)
```
